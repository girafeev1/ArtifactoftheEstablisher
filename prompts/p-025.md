## Save path

## Branch & PR
- Branch: codex/fix-payment-ui-and-inline-editing-p025
- PR title: fix(payment): sticky footer Back, correct blinking, restore session assignment, inline editing; remove docs/task-log-vol-1.md (P-025)
- Labels: payments, ui, codex, docs

## Goals
1) Back button belongs to sticky footer  
2) Payment Detail: only Remaining blinks  
3) Session assignment list always visible & functional  
4) Inline editing (Payment Detail) for empty fields → read-only after set  
5) Base Rate History: inline effectiveDate when empty → read-only  
6) Remove `docs/task-log-vol-1.md` (canonical is `docs/Task Log.md`)

## Implement
A) **Back in sticky footer** (move control into footer bar; body gets bottom padding).
B) **Blinking**: Payment Amount static; Remaining uses blink class once.
C) **Assignment**: persistent shell with zero-state; selection updates Remaining; persist as today.
D) **Inline editing**: method/entity/identifier/refNumber editable only when empty; after save, read-only; reuse identifier normalization.
E) **Base Rate History**: if effectiveDate empty, allow inline edit; then read-only.
F) **Docs**: delete `docs/task-log-vol-1.md`.

## Tests
- Unit: identifier normalization.
- E2E: Remaining blinks only; assignment works; inline edit flows.

## Acceptance
- Back in sticky footer; single Remaining blink; assignment stable; inline-on-empty works; base rate date edit works; stray log removed.
