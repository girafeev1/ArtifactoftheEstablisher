## Current Focus

### In Progress
### T-107
- Title: Invoice detail editing toggle & number editing parity (P-038)
- Branch: main
- PR: —
- Status: ⏳ In Progress
- Outcomes (planned):
  - Allow invoice number edits regardless of invoice count; ensure toggling resets the working draft safely.
  - Relocate the header edit action beside Project Pickup Date and update styling per request.
- Progress:
  - Merged “Edit Invoice Details” into a single “Manage Invoices” control; entering Manage also enables detail editing.
  - Pending (unsaved) invoice row uses a Close icon instead of trash; cancel exits detail-edit state.
  - Removed legacy labels; show “Commit Changes” while editing, otherwise “Manage Invoices”.
  - “No changes made” message surfaces when saving without edits; avoids PATCH.
  - “Add additional invoice” row hides correctly after exiting manage mode.

### T-108
- Title: Invoice item layout polish (Sub-Qty, Notes, widths) (P-039)
- Branch: main
- PR: —
- Status: ⏳ In Progress
- Outcomes (planned):
  - Ensure “Sub-Qty” is inline at the right-end of the Item Title row in both view and edit modes.
  - Show bank name abbreviation only when it has 4+ tokens; otherwise show full name (e.g., “Dah Sing Bank” stays full).
  - Add a quantity unit line beneath Unit Price to capture strings like “/hour” alongside numeric values.
  - Surface per-item discounts beneath each total instead of a dedicated column.
- Progress:
  - Narrowed the “To” column in the invoice table to free space for items. ✅
  - Notes render with preserved line breaks (pre-wrap); table cells allow wrapping. ✅
  - “Sub-Qty” is inline, right-aligned with the Item Title in both view and edit modes. ✅
  - Bank name abbreviation shows only for names with 4+ tokens; 3-token names (e.g., “Dah Sing Bank”) show in full. ✅
  - Item title/fee type/notes weights standardized (Medium/Extra Light/Light) in view and edit modes. ✅
  - Unit Price column now stores & displays `/unit` beneath the amount (editable inline). ✅
  - Discounts captured under the Total column; view mode shows a red “OFF” chip, edit mode offers borderless input. ✅
  - Total row status shows “All Cleared”, “All Due”, or “Partially” based on invoice outcomes. ✅
  - Unit Price, Qty, and Total columns stay right-aligned in both edit and read modes for consistent layout. ✅
  - Sub-Qty placement: inline after title in view mode; a line below the title in edit mode. ✅
  - Update — 2025-11-04:
    - Sub-Qty is italic in view mode and left-aligned when on its own line in edit mode. ✅
    - The “/” unit marker is a prefix on the same line as the unit input in edit mode; view mode shows `/unit` beneath the amount. ✅
    - Discount input is right-aligned in edit mode; a red “OFF” chip renders beneath the row total in view mode when discount > 0. ✅
    - A gray divider appears above the total row; total status reads All Cleared / All Due / Partially. ✅
