## Coding conventions
- For every `.ts`, `.tsx`, or `.js` file you modify or create, insert a comment on the first line in the format `// <relative file path>` representing the path from the repository root.
- If such a comment already exists, update it if the path is incorrect.

## Test commands
- Run `npm test` from the repository root before committing any changes.
