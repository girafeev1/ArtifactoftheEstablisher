# Update Notes

## BillingTab field order
- Introduced constant FIELD_KEYS to render fields in consistent order.
- Updated LABELS to remove colons as requested.
- Refactored BillingTab.tsx to map over FIELD_KEYS rather than Object.entries.
- Added empty catch comments in clientLogger.ts to satisfy lint rules.
